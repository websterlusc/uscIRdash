With the 2024 edition of the USC Factbook, we renew our commitment to transparency and accountability, presenting a clear and detailed account of our university’s growth, progress, and aspirations. As we draw closer to USC’s centennial in 2027, our journey is guided by SP100, a strategic plan that sets forth our mission-driven priorities in service to our students, our faith, and our community.

SP100 is a vision rooted in five essential priorities: Spiritual
Ethos, Academic Success, Faculty and Staff Development, Financial Sustainability, and Operational Efficiency. These pillars drive our efforts to foster a campus culture that honors Christian service, enhances academic outcomes, supports our faculty and staff, ensures financial resilience, and strengthens the efficiency and quality of our operations. Through this framework, we aim to empower students to flourish in their academic journeys, enhance our engagement with alumni and partners, and maintain a vibrant, safe, and technologically advanced campus environment.

The USC Factbook plays an essential role in this journey by offering a comprehensive, data- informed view of our present reality. In it, we can measure our progress, identify areas for growth, and ensure alignment with our goals. I am confident that this publication will serve as a valuable tool for decision-making and strategic planning, and I invite our stakeholders— faculty, staff, students, alumni, and partners—to utilize it in our shared mission of building a stronger, more impactful USC.

I extend my sincere gratitude to Ms. Nordian Swaby-Robinson and the Department of Institutional Research, as well as all contributing departments, for their dedication in compiling this report. As we move forward, may the insights offered by this Factbook guide us in building a legacy of excellence for our centennial and beyond.
