Representation of Interest groups
Encouraging the greatest degree of meaningful participation in decision-making and the
generation of ideas the universityâ€™s governance structure is intentionally inclusive of organized interest groups including but not limited to alumni,
democratically elected student government (the Associated Student Body), and faculty and staff senates.
The majority of the standing and ad hoc committees of the university include voices that represent the widest practical and
possible collection of voices and interests. Participation in institutional governance is an embedded feature of our organizational culture.
